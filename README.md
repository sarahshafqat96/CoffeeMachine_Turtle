- Money input and validation.
- Coffee preparation process simulation.
- Change calculation and display.
- Detailed prompts and messages for a seamless user experience.

# Information and Installation
The codes are written in 3 files stored in the "code" folder in this directory. The "ingredients.py file" is important as it stores all the information regarding various types of coffee, their required resources and cost. All the images used for developing the GUI of the game are stored in the "images" folder. Make sure you 
download all the files in a single directory in your computer and run the "main.py" file on your local machine.

You will just need Python installed on your local machine for this project.
